# Wunki's Django Template

After doing a gazillion Django projects I saw some recurring patterns. This
project template for Django is the template I use for new projects. It
contains the configuration and setup for the following packages:

- South
- Celery
- Amazon S3 (production)
- Django extensions
- Debug toolbar (development)

The setup is working with a local PostgreSQL database.

## Usage
